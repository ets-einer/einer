## Development

### Roadmap

All progress tracking will be made in [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)

### Docs

Docs are now in this repository inside the `docs` folder, powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

To access it locally, you can run:

```sh
# certify that you are in the repository root directory
$ pnpm run docs

# If you are running the docusaurus inside a docker, run this instead
$ pnpm run docs -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Aplications Ports

We decided to define our convetion in the following way:

- Web Apps (vite): 3000
- Web App services: 4000
- Common Services: 5000
- Databases: 6000
- Others: 7000

So for all our applications the port mapping is:

| App         | Port |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Web Common  | 3000 |
| Web Borum   | 3001 |
| Web Planner | 3002 |
| Web VSDIA   | 3003 |

| Services                  | Port |
| ------------------------- | ---- |
| Service Borum             | 4001 |
| Service Planner           | 4002 |
| Service VSDIA             | 4003 |
| Service Authentication    | 5000 |
| Service S3 (File Storage) | 5001 |

| Databases            | Port |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| Authentication Redis | 6000 |
